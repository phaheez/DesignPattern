# DesignPattern
Design Pattern with C# .NET5

### Singleton
- It allows us to create a single instance of an object and to share that instance with all the users that require it.

### Factory Design Pattern
- One of the most frequently used design patterns in real-time applications.
- It provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- It defines a method that we can use to create an object instead of using its constructor.
- Subclasses can override this method and create objects of different types.
- It create an object without exposing the object creation logic to the client and the client will refer to the newly created object using a common interface
- Create interface with methods and other classes implement it
